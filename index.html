            <p>The Way of the Essentialist involves doing less, but better, so that you can make the highest possible contribution to your projects, interests, and life. It's not about getting more done in less time, or about only getting less done. It's about getting only the RIGHT things done. It's about regaining control of your own choices about where to spend your time and energy, instead of giving others permission to choose for you.</p>
